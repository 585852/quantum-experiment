= Overview =
This is a simple branch-based test creation, management, and execution environment.

== Organization ==
This repo contains:
{|
 ! chroot/
 | A self-contained and versioned environment for executing tests
 |-
 ! tests/test.py
 | The test entry point.  Contains an initial example test.
 |- 
 ! bin/run-test.sh
 | A script for executing a particular test (see below)
 |-
 ! bin/setup-chroot.sh
 | A script for preparing and executing in the chroot environment
 |}

= Creating a Test =
Here are the steps for creating a test for a bug (e.g., EUCA-1234)
IMPORTANT:  NEVER modify the master branch.  Always use a seperate branch per test.
1. Create a branch for your test:
  git checkout -b EUCA-1234 master
2. Modify tests/test.py to do whatever is needed.  Additional files should go into tests/ so they can be setup for execution in the chroot.
3. Commit changes you are ready to try
  git commit -m 'Commit my awesome test' tests/

= Running & Debugging a Test =
4. Try your test out
  ./bin/run-test.sh EUCA-1234 /path/to/my-cloud.conf
5. Find the output of the test by the dated branch name created
  git branch | grep EUCA-1234
6. Debug your test by dropping into the chroot and running it by hand
  ./bin/setup-chroot.sh /bin/bash -i
  /root/tests/test.py /root/cloud.conf
  exit
